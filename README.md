# VAT-Spy Client Data Updates

VAT-Spy is an Air Traffic and ATC Display client that was designed by Ross Carlson for the VATSIM Network. VAT-Spy can be obtained at http://www1.metacraft.com/VATSpy/.

VATSIM Caribbean Division (VATCAR) has taken the steps to attempt to create a central source of maintained data for this client. It is the hope that this will become a community based project, with members from across the VATSIM Network from various Regions, Divisions, and FIRs/ARTCCs taking steps to contribute and give back to the community and keep the data current. Regions, Divisions, and FIRs/ARTCCs are all welcome to submit their requests for updates.

# How Do I Submit Updates?
